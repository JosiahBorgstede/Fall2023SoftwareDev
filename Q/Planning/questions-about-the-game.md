Subject: Questions about the game

"The players take turns in descending turns of age;" how is "age" defined?

Does a tile need to match shapes only with its neighbors or with the whole line?

(Clarification: Suppose that the referee puts down a red diamond on an empty
board. Then, the first player puts down a red clover above the red diamond.
Does this mean that on subsequent turns, players can only match colors along
this column because there is no single shape corresponding to the column?)

If a tile connects two contiguous sequences, does that give 1 or 2 points?
